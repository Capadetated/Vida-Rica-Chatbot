# Vida-Rica-Chatbot

This Watson Assistant-based project showcased how a chatbot can be designed, developed, implemented, and improved. An example chatbot was made for a fictional restaurant, Vida Rica, which has functions to order food, confirm order, gather emails/feedback, and give various types of information.

"Vida Rica Chatbot Development.pdf" contains the text of the analysis along with the supporting figures and tables. "Vida-Rica Pre Test.json" contains the code for the chatbot prior to Day 1 of testing, whereas "Vida-Rica Post Test.json" contains the code for the chatbot after adjustments were made for Day 2 of testing.
